Three heterogeneous feature descriptors are ISO, LDA, and NPE, where ISO visually represents the three-dimensional objects in two dimensions, 
LDA finds a linear combination of features that can separate two or more classes of objects, and NPE can preserve the local neighborhood
structure on the data manifold.

COIL20: Each image is represented by three heterogeneous feature sets: 30 isometric projection (ISO), 19 linear discriminant analysis
(LDA), and 30 neighborhood preserving embedding (NPE).

MNIST-10k: These digits are described by using three heterogeneous feature sets: 30 ISO, 9 LDA, and 30 NPE.

YALE32: Each image is expressed by three heterogeneous feature sets: 30 ISO, 14 LDA, and 30 NPE.
